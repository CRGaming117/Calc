# The Calc App
My personal calculator app. 
Built using the Java Swing libraries for the GUI and Jython's Python Interpreter for processing the mathematical expressions. This allows the user to calculate all operations in Python and its Math library. 
These are the following four planned modes within this app.


## Standard Mode
Basic calculations for integer and float numbers.

## Scientific Mode
**Coming Soon.** For more complex math and trigonometry.

## Graphng Mode
**Coming Soon.** To visualize polynomial equations.

## Sequence 
**Coming Soon.** To calculate sequences and series.
